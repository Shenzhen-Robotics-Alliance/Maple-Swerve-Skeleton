However, because the robot is constantly in motion, there will always be a delay in the response of the PID controller. This delay can cause the robot to lag behind the desired heading. To compensate for this, a feed-forward angular velocity is introduced, which proactively adjusts the robot's rotation based on its speed and direction, helping to reduce the delay and improve the robot's ability to maintain its alignment with the target in real-time.</p> <p>In brief, given the target's position, the robot's position, and its velocity, we calculate the rate of change of the robot's desired rotation to maintain alignment with the target.</p> <p></p>"},{"location":"technical%20specification/3%20-%20heading%20control/3.2%20-%20aiming%20at%20target/#1-calculate-targets-velocity-relative-to-the-robot","title":"1.
